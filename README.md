# iWeather

This project is a React Native application developed for educational purposes, focusing on learning and implementing testing strategies, as well as understanding the CI/CD and deployment processes within a React Native environment.
The goal was to explore different testing tools and automation techniques, starting from an existing project template, while also simulating how deployment pipelines would work in real-world scenarios.

Although we didn’t actually publish the app to the stores due to associated costs, we followed the complete deployment process in theory, learned how to configure it, and built CI/CD pipelines to automate future releases.
Even though these pipelines couldn’t be tested in production (since we didn’t pay the store fees), we gained a solid understanding of how they should function and implemented their logic in code.

## 🧩 Base Template

This project is based on the iWeather[https://github.com/rocketseat-education/iweather] template developed by Rocketseat Education.
We are using this template as a starting point to add, structure, and practice automated tests.
