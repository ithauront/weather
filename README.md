# Weather

This project is a React Native application focused on learning and implementing tests.
The goal is to explore different testing strategies and tools within a React Native environment, starting from an existing project template.

## ðŸ§© Base Template

This project is based on the iWeather[https://github.com/rocketseat-education/iweather] template developed by Rocketseat Education.
We are using this template as a starting point to add, structure, and practice automated tests.
